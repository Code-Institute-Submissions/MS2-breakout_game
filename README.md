#### This basic breakout game project aims to put my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript into practice and improve my skills in interactive functionalities.  This project is also a tribute to the original 1970s Breakout Game made by Steve Wozniak, which inspired certain aspects of Apple II computers.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Breakout Game Player Goals

        1. As a First Time Game Player, I want to easily understand how to play the breakout game.
        2. As a First Time Game Player, I want to easily manipulate the paddle to play.
        3. As a First Time Game Player, I want to be visually motivated while playing.
        4. 

    -   #### Experienced Breakout Game Player Goals

        1. As an Experienced Breakout Game Player, I want to play the game smoothly without unnecessary distractions.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   With reference to the classic breakout game in 1970s, this game has a white canvas on black background for stronger visual impact, and elements/texts are filled with rainbow colours.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Anton font is the main font used throughout the whole website with cursive as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Anton is a bold font with excellent visual result for game background, and it is easy to read.
    -   #### Sound
        -   Sound effects are essential to motivate the player, although in this project the sound clips were made by myself from free resources.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, FireFox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8.
-   Friends and family members were asked to play the game to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On mobile devices with small screens, the play experience might be very limited, while on devices with large screen such as iMac, the user experience is better when the browser window is minished.
-   The bricks might not be centered in some browser windows.
-   The ball sometimes pierces through bricks instead of break them.
-   The ball sometimes sinks into the paddle instead of touching the top edge.
